    <h3>Carbon footprint <BlockIcon>🌍</BlockIcon></h3>
    <p>The Internet requires energy, which leads to carbon emissions. According to <a href="https://www.websitecarbon.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">websitecarbon.com</a>, the average website produces about 0,5 gram of CO2 per page view. Normal websites are built each time they are loaded, but using modern technology we can make sure they are only built once. For this website, I have made sure to keep the design simple and minimize the amount of images and videos. The images are compressed and adapted to the screen resolution. Hosting the site on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Netlify</a> means that it is running on sustainable energy. And of course, this site is using a modern Javascript framework (<a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Next.js</a>), which means it is only built when I publish any changes.</p>
    
    <p>The carbon footprint for this website is 0,12 gram of CO2 per page view.</p>

    <h3>AI usage <BlockIcon>🤖</BlockIcon></h3>
    <p>I have not used generative AI for the content on this website. Not only because I prefer to use my own brain and creativity, but also because the Large Language Models (LLMs) are associated with high energy consumption and water usage. Even though some LLMs are more or less running on renewable energy, they still require a lot of resources, which I do not believe is worth it when it comes to dealing with everyday problems. For instance, one single prompt in ChatGPT might require up to 15 times more energy than a Google search*.</p>
